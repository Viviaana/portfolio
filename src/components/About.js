                <p>Growing up in the 90's I got to see technology evolve faster than anyone could keep up with and I loved it. As far back as I can remember I was obsessed with computers and gaming, from the SNES at the after school club that I’d hog constantly, to finally getting my very own Gameboy and playing Super Mario 2 for so long I’d go through so many batteries, even just getting to play the storybook point and click adventures in school. To this day I’m still hooked and comparing new games to what I grew up with still blows my mind. A lot of my time is taken up by gaming, I even recently set up a game room in my house including all my childhood consoles and a full set up for my PC, it’s my little piece of heaven. Though my total played time on world of Warcraft isn’t something I’m proud of(that's a lie), it's hard to let go of a character after being them for nearly 10 years.</p>
                <p>Even though I’m a secret old lady, spending most of my time crocheting with my cat, it’s not all indoors. I’m also an axe thrower, I was part of a league over the last year and I’ve spent months working on the perfect throw, I can now almost hit the target sometimes! We also host a board game night once a week where we try and get through the hundreds of games we’ve all bought over the years, I usually prefer the quicker games, though I love games like Settlers of Catan, but we tend to end up playing games that last for hours (At least it’s a good excuse to order pizza) We’ve started to branch out into doing escape rooms together, my favourite one was where we were split into 2 teams in identical rooms and had to try and get out before the others (we obviously won that one otherwise it wouldn’t be my favourite).</p>
